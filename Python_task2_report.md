Internship Task 2 – Report
Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
Role: Python Developer Intern

9. Prime Number
Approach: Checked whether the given number is greater than 1, then iterated from 2 to square root of n to find any divisors. If no divisors are found, the number is prime.
Concepts Used: Loops, conditional checks, mathematical logic, range(), typecasting.

10. Sum of Digits
Approach: Converted the number to a string, iterated through each character, converted it back to an integer, and summed the digits.
Concepts Used: String conversion, loops, typecasting, arithmetic addition.

11. LCM and GCD
Approach: Used Python’s math.gcd() to find GCD, then calculated LCM using the formula LCM = (a * b) / GCD.
Concepts Used: math module, arithmetic operations, integer division, functions.

12. List Reversal
Approach: Implemented a loop to swap elements from both ends of the list until the middle was reached, without using any built-in reverse functions.
Concepts Used: Looping, list indexing, in-place swapping.

13. Sort a List
Approach: Implemented Bubble Sort algorithm by comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if out of order. Repeated this until the list was sorted.
Concepts Used: Nested loops, conditional comparison, sorting logic.

14. Remove Duplicates
Approach: Created a new list and added elements from the original list only if they were not already present.
Concepts Used: Loops, conditional logic, list operations.

15. String Length
Approach: Used a loop to iterate through each character of the string and incremented a counter variable to determine the length.
Concepts Used: Looping, counters, string traversal.

16. Count Vowels and Consonants
Approach: Defined a set of vowels, then iterated through each character of the string. If it's an alphabet character, classified it as a vowel or consonant accordingly.
Concepts Used: Sets, loops, string methods, conditional checks.
